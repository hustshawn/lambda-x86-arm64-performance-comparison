# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a Lambda-based data processing solution to compare performance between ARM64 and x86_64 architectures using Python 3.11. The solution uses AWS SAM for infrastructure as code, ensuring consistent deployment and configuration across both architectures. The system will process computational workloads and capture detailed performance metrics for comparison analysis.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. SAM Template Structure

**File**: `template.yaml`
- Defines two identical Lambda functions with different architectures
- Configures API Gateway endpoints for HTTP invocation
- Sets up IAM roles and permissions
- Defines CloudWatch custom metrics permissions

### 2. Lambda Function Code

**File**: `src/lambda_function.py`
- Single codebase shared between both architectures
- Implements data processing logic using Python 3.11 features
- Captures performance metrics (execution time, memory usage)
- Handles both API Gateway and direct invocation events

### 3. Data Processing Module

**File**: `src/data_processor.py`
- Contains computational workloads for performance testing
- Implements various algorithms (sorting, mathematical computations, string processing)
- Designed to stress both CPU and memory to highlight architecture differences

### 4. Performance Metrics Module

**File**: `src/metrics.py`
- Captures execution time with high precision
- Monitors memory usage during processing
- Sends custom metrics to CloudWatch
- Formats performance data for consistent output

### 5. Test Utilities

**File**: `tests/performance_test.py`
- Automated testing scripts for batch invocation
- Generates test data sets of varying sizes
- Collects and aggregates performance results
- Provides statistical analysis of performance differences

## Data Models

### Input Event Schema

```python
{
    "operation": str,  # Type of data processing operation
    "data_size": int,  # Size of data to process (for scaling tests)
    "iterations": int, # Number of iterations to run
    "payload": dict    # Actual data to process
}
```

### Performance Metrics Schema

```python
{
    "architecture": str,        # "arm64" or "x86_64"
    "operation": str,          # Operation performed
    "execution_time_ms": float, # Total execution time
    "memory_used_mb": float,   # Peak memory usage
    "cold_start": bool,        # Whether this was a cold start
    "data_size": int,          # Size of processed data
    "iterations": int,         # Number of iterations
    "timestamp": str,          # ISO timestamp
