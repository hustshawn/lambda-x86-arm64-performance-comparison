# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up project structure and SAM template
  - Create directory structure for Lambda source code, tests, and configuration files
  - Initialize SAM template with basic structure for dual-architecture Lambda functions
  - Configure Python 3.11 runtime and architecture specifications
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Implement core data processing module
  - Create data_processor.py with computational workloads designed to stress CPU and memory
  - Implement multiple processing algorithms (sorting, mathematical computations, string processing)
  - Design workloads that can highlight performance differences between ARM64 and x86_64
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Create performance metrics collection system
  - Implement metrics.py module to capture execution time with high precision timing
  - Add memory usage monitoring during data processing operations
  - Create CloudWatch custom metrics integration for real-time performance tracking
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 4. Develop main Lambda function handler
  - Create lambda_function.py with handler that processes both API Gateway and direct invocation events
  - Integrate data processing module with performance metrics collection
  - Implement input validation and error handling for robust operation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Complete SAM template configuration
  - Define two Lambda functions with identical code but different architectures (arm64 and x86_64)
  - Configure API Gateway REST endpoints for HTTP invocation of both functions
  - Set up IAM roles with minimal required permissions for CloudWatch metrics
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 6. Implement automated testing utilities
  - Create performance_test.py for batch invocation and automated testing
  - Generate test data sets of varying sizes for comprehensive performance evaluation
  - Implement statistical analysis functions to compare performance between architectures
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Implement structured logging throughout all modules for easy analysis
  - Add graceful error handling for memory constraints and timeout scenarios
  - Create proper HTTP error responses with descriptive messages
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.2_

- [ ] 8. Create unit tests for core functionality
  - Write unit tests for data processing algorithms to validate correctness
  - Test performance metrics collection accuracy and formatting
  - Validate input event parsing and response generation
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 9. Implement local testing configuration
  - Configure SAM CLI local testing capabilities for development workflow
  - Create sample event files for testing different processing scenarios
  - Set up local API Gateway testing for HTTP endpoint validation
  - _Requirements: 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Add deployment and invocation documentation
  - Create README with clear instructions for building and deploying the SAM application
  - Document API endpoints and payload formats for easy testing
  - Provide examples of direct Lambda invocation and batch testing procedures
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_
