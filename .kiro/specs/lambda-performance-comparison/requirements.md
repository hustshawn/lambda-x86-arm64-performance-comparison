# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a data processing solution using AWS Lambda functions with Python 3.11 runtime, designed to compare performance between ARM64 and x86_64 architectures. The solution will use AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for infrastructure as code to automate deployment and ensure consistent environments for performance comparison.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy identical Lambda functions on both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures, so that I can compare their performance characteristics for data processing workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SAM template is deployed THEN the system SHALL create two Lambda functions with identical code but different architectures (arm64 and x86_64)
2. WHEN each Lambda function is invoked THEN the system SHALL process the same data processing logic using Python 3.11 runtime
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints or triggers for both Lambda functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement data processing logic in Python 3.11, so that I can leverage modern Python features and performance optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function receives input data THEN the system SHALL process the data using Python 3.11 runtime
2. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL implement meaningful computational work that can demonstrate performance differences
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL return structured results including processing metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use AWS SAM for infrastructure as code, so that I can automate deployment and maintain consistent environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SAM template is defined THEN the system SHALL specify all necessary AWS resources including Lambda functions, IAM roles, and any required triggers
2. WHEN SAM build is executed THEN the system SHALL package the Python code and dependencies correctly
3. WHEN SAM deploy is executed THEN the system SHALL create all resources in AWS with proper configuration
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide stack outputs with function ARNs and invocation details

### Requirement 4`

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collect performance metrics from both architectures, so that I can make data-driven comparisons between ARM64 and x86_64 performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each Lambda function executes THEN the system SHALL capture execution duration, memory usage, and cold start metrics
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL log performance data in a structured format
3. WHEN multiple invocations occur THEN the system SHALL enable aggregation of performance metrics for comparison
4. IF CloudWatch integration is available THEN the system SHALL send custom metrics to CloudWatch for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily invoke and test both Lambda functions, so that I can generate performance comparison data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for invoking both functions
2. WHEN functions are invoked THEN the system SHALL accept the same input format for consistent testing
3. WHEN testing multiple scenarios THEN the system SHALL support batch invocation or automated testing approaches
4. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide comparable output formats from both architectures
