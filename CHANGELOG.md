## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This initial release provides a comprehensive performance comparison framework for AWS Lambda architectures. Key achievements:

- **Complete Testing Suite**: Four different workload types covering various performance aspects
- **Real Performance Data**: Demonstrable ARM64 advantages across all test categories
- **Production Ready**: Full deployment automation with monitoring and observability
- **Developer Friendly**: Extensive documentation and local testing capabilities
- **Cost Optimization**: Clear demonstration of price-performance benefits

### Migration from Beta

This is the first stable release. No migration is required.

### Breaking Changes

None in this initial release.

### Deprecations

None in this initial release.

### Security Updates

- Implemented input validation for all API endpoints
- Added appropriate IAM permissions with least privilege principle
- Enabled AWS X-Ray tracing for security monitoring

### Known Issues

- Cold start times may vary significantly based on AWS region and time of day
- Memory intensive workloads may timeout with very large memory allocations (>100MB)
- Local testing requires Docker and may not perfectly replicate AWS Lambda environment

### Upgrade Instructions

This is the initial release, no upgrade instructions needed.
